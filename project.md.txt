# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
**AutoSync**

**Version:** MVP v1.0  
**Prepared for:** AI Development Agent  
**Prepared by:** [Founder Name]  

---

## 1. Product Summary
AutoSync is a mobile app that helps car owners automatically track and manage routine vehicle maintenance.  
It eliminates manual record-keeping by allowing users to upload odometer photos, get AI-based mileage detection, receive maintenance reminders, and store all service records digitally.  
The MVP focuses on simplicity: fast setup, smart reminders, and a clear digital logbook.  

---

## 2. Target Users
- **Primary:** Individual car owners who want to keep maintenance organized without hardware devices.  
- **Secondary:** Used car buyers who want a transparent digital service history.  
- **Tertiary:** Small garages/mechanics that could later integrate records for clients.  

---

## 3. Core Problem
Car owners forget or lose track of scheduled maintenance and paper records.  
There’s no simple app that uses mileage photos + reminders + digital history to automate this process.  

---

## 4. Goals for MVP
- Reduce friction in tracking car maintenance.  
- Automatically extract mileage from photos.  
- Provide basic, reliable reminders for maintenance tasks.  
- Build a shareable, exportable digital maintenance logbook.  

---

## 5. Core Features (MVP Scope)

### A. User Onboarding
- Sign-up with email, Google, or Apple.  
- Add car by:
  - Entering make, model, year manually.  
  - Scanning VIN (optional).  
- Set up base mileage (manual input or odometer photo).  

### B. Odometer Recognition (AI Feature)
- Upload photo → OCR reads numeric mileage.  
- Confidence score shown; user can edit mileage if OCR is uncertain.  
- Store image + extracted value + timestamp.  

### C. Smart Maintenance Reminders
- Auto-generated reminder list based on car model and average intervals (oil, filters, brakes, inspections).  
- Users can add custom maintenance types.  
- Notifications triggered by:
  - Mileage thresholds (e.g., every 10,000 km).  
  - Time thresholds (e.g., 6 months).  

### D. Digital Logbook
- CRUD structure:
  - **Create:** Add service record (title, date, mileage, cost, notes).  
  - **Read:** View past services sorted by date/mileage.  
  - **Update/Delete:** Edit or remove entries.  
- **OCR Receipt Scanning:** optional; upload mechanic receipt → extract service details.  

### E. Timeline View
- Horizontal scroll timeline showing:
  - Past services (green)  
  - Upcoming maintenance (orange)  
  - Overdue items (red)  
- Each entry opens detail view (service name, notes, photo attachments).  

### F. PDF Export
- Generate “Digital Service Book” PDF with:
  - Vehicle info  
  - Maintenance history (chronological list)  
  - Attached images (optional thumbnails)  
- Share via email or download locally.  

### G. Multi-Car Support
- Add multiple cars under one user account.  
- Switch easily between vehicles in dashboard.  

### H. Mechanic Finder (MVP-lite)
- Static map view showing nearby garages (use Google Maps API).  
- Simple info cards: name, phone, address, rating.
